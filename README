Included files:
   - lab0.c = C source code that parses options and implements program that copies standard input to standard output
     options:
	--input=[filename] : use specified file as standard input (exit with 2 if fails)
	--output=[filename] : create specified file and use as standard output (exit with 3 if fails)
	--segfault : force a segmentation fault
	--catch : register signal handler that deals with segmentation fault and exit with return code 4\
     (exits with 1 if invalid argument is found)
   - test.sh = external bash script containing smoke tests for lab0.c
   - Makefile = builds program and tarball (targets: check = smoke tests, clean = rm all created files, dist = make tarball)
   - backtrace.png = shows segfault and associated stack-trace in gdb session
   - breakpoint.png  = shows breakpoint and variable inspection before segfault in gdb

make check => smoke tests:
   - test for correct exit code (1) when given invalid  option (short and long)
   - test for correct exit code (2) when trying to open nonexistent file for input
   - test for correct axit code (3) when trying to write to inaccessible file for output
   - test for correct exit code (139) when segfault occurs
   - test for correct exit code (4) when segfault occurs with catch option on
   - test for correct functionality when input and output are valid files
   - test for correct exit code when dealing with --segfault option as well as invalid input and output files
